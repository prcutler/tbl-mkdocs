# Show Notes

## Episode Intro
Welcome!

### macOS Ventura cannot copy UF2 files (Paul #1) 00:21
  * [Adafruit Blog post](https://blog.adafruit.com/2022/10/31/uploading-uf2-files-with-macos-13-0-ventura-apple-microbit_edu-raspberry_pi-circuitpython/)
  * [Raspberry Pi Blog](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/the-ventura-problem/)
  * You cannot drag and drop UF2 and HEX files using macOS Finder - it results in an error
  * Lady Ada gave a good overview of the technical issues in [Ask an Engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ur8MsnF7Eo0)
  * Two workarounds
    * Use the terminal: `cp -X blink.uf2 /Volumes/RPI-RP2/`
    * Install a macOS short created by Alasdair Allen (author of the Rasperry Pi blog post above)
      * [Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/989b90c87fec4c11965dd517685f87cd)
      * Works great!  Update Shortcuts settings to allow shell scripts and just right click a UF2 image to transfer it
  * Help out and file a bug report with Apple!

### Matter officially supported in iOS 16.1 (Tod #1) 2:37
  * What is Matter?
    * Matter is an open standard for smart home IoT stuff (Apple, Google, Amazon, etc all signed on)
    * [Matter 1.0 spec just released (stared in 2019)](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/4/23386883/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-google-launch)
    * Created by what was the Zigbee Alliance (Zigbee being a BLE-like protocol from a decade ago)
    * Matter, however, sits on top of existing WiFi or BLE protocols
    * Most examples I've seen are WiFi-based
    * IOS 16.1 now just sees them
    * Matter was originally called Project CHIP, why their github org is named 'project-chip',
  * [Eric from ThatProject Youtube channel demos it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2doZomr9V0)
  * [Eric also posted to reddit in r/esp32](https://www.reddit.com/r/esp32/comments/yfvpxu/finally_apple_officially_supports_matter_in_161/)
  * [Their Github repo has useful ESP32-based examples](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/tree/master/examples)
  * [ThatProject Eric also has a great Github Repo of ESP32 IoT projects](https://github.com/0015/ThatProject)
  * ~~~[Matter pre-compiled example apps from Nabu Casa / Home Assistant Cloud](https://nabucasa.github.io/matter-example-apps/)~~~

### 3D printing for good causes (Paul #2) 7:00
  * [3D Printing for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention Campaign](https://3dwithus.com/3d-printing-for-mental-health-and-suicide-prevention)
    * The idea was started by a teacher, Abby Brown, at Torrey Pines High School.
    * Each year the school has Yellow Ribbon week where students are learn about crisis resources and risk factors for suicide.
    * The keychains were designed to give away to her students as a special way to end Yellow Ribbon Week.
    * Each keychain contains a word, such as "Smile", "Inspire", "Create", with about 10 different words.
    * There's a fundraising campaign where you can print one of the designs found on Cults3D and post it on Twitter and Instagram.
    * Different organizations are matching the funds, with an opportunity to raise over $4000 by just printing and sharing!
      * Joel Telling, Printed Solid, LDO Motors, and Alien3D
  * [https://www.ic3dprinters.com/2022-toys/](3D Printed Toys for Tots campaign)
    * Organized by IC3D in 2018, they work with volunteers in the 3D printing community to print toys for kids
      * Over 69,000 toys printed in 2021!
      * This year they have over 140 volunteers and have printed 27,000 toys so far.
      * You can donate financially or sign up to help print toys
      * Toys include an articulated alligator, a train engine, cars, low poly dinosaurs, and more.
    * The signup period is now over to volunteer for printing, but keep an eye out for this next year.

### Hypno "video synthesizer" from Sleepy Circuits (Tod #2) 10:00
  * Have you ever taken a camcorder and point it at the TV to get weird video feedback?
  * Have you ever enjoyed those trippy algorithmic screen savers?
  * You can do both in real-time with devices called "[video synthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_synthesizer)"
  * I was at [Synthplex](https://synthplex.com/) last weekend and it was fun!
    * It's mostly a audio synth convention but there were a few non-audio things there too, like:
  * Hypno by Sleepy Circuits is one such device
  * Physically it's a small box with knobs, sliders, and buttons. And an HDMI port! (and NDI over USB for streaming)
  * Twiddle the knobs & sliders to create generative video patterns
  * Source material can be video "oscillators", camera feeds, video files
  * Raspberry Pi 3 or 4-based, with Eurorack-compatible jacks to sync to your music
  * Been in development since 2019
  * Extensive documentation and a big community, with an [active forum](https://forum.sleepycircuits.com/)
  * (Product page](https://sleepycircuits.com/hypno)
  * [Example videos on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/sleepycircuits/)

### [IO Rodeo Launches the Open Colorimeter, a CircuitPython Analysis Tool for Citizen Science - Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/news/io-rodeo-launches-the-open-colorimeter-a-circuitpython-analysis-tool-for-citizen-science-4e0435072e21) (Paul #3) 13:10
  * Hackster.io article from Gareth Halfacree
  * The Open Colorimeter is an instrument with many applications, including measuring contaminants & pollutants in soil & water
    * Based on the Adafruit PyBadge
    * 3D printed case
    * Published under open licenses
      * MIT for the firmware
      * Physical designs under a CC-4.0 license
    * Excellent documentation with product guides and project tutorials
    * Example: [measure the blue dye in sports drinks](https://blog.iorodeo.com/tutorial-measuring-blue-food-dye-in-sports-drinks/)
  * IO Rodeo's mission is to increase accessibility to scientific data collection tools by creating low-cost, open hardware instrumentation.
  * Open Hardware and Software: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/iorodeo/)

### ffmpeg.guide makes configuring FFMPEG easy (Tod #3) 15:40
  * https://ffmpeg.guide
  * [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/) is tool used behind-the-scenes by many video processors including MPlayer, Handbrake, VLC
  * And used by many websites that handle A/V
  * At it's simplist, it converts video formats (AVI to MP4) but it can do so much more
  * I use it to:
      * Down-convert HDR video to SDR, resample to 720p (for players that don't support HDR)
      * Quickly cropping videos in a bit when shooting with a wide-angle lens
      * Recompress 4K video to 1080p with reduced bitrate usable by Twitter/Youtube
      * Convert audio of any format to .WAV
  * [Example FFMEG commands](https://catswhocode.com/ffmpeg-commands/)
  * FFMPEG can do much more and it's famously complicated to use
  * It's been around for over 20 years!  wow!
  * "ffmpeg.guide" is a "Flows & nodes"-based GUI for generating FFMPEG commandline commands
  * Free for up to 5 nodes
  * [Developer post announcing it](https://twitter.com/zack_overflow/status/1586288992680493057)
